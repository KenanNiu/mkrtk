**MKRTK** is a Matlab toolkit for reconstructing joint kinematics from structural MRI scans.

The methodology for the technique implemented here is being presented in a publication that has been submitted for review.  A link will be provided to the publication once available.  All the code required to do this analysis can be downloaded from this site either as a zip file, or from the git repository.

In essence, MKRTK provides a 2D segmentation tool for segmenting the scans and creating 3D geometries from the MR image slices, and a 3D registration tool to register high resolution static models with low resolution dynamic models to reconstruct the motion of the segmented structures.
